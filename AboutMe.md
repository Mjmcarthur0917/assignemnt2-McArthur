# Matthew McArthur

My name is Matthew McArthur and I am a senior at NWMSU and am pursuing a bachelors degree in Cyber Security. I am from Lee's Summit, MO. I love to hunt and fish and shoot guns. I currently am apart of the Northwest Fishing team where I participate in tournaments and kayak tournaments. A hobby of mine that I really enjoy is blade smitthing. It is a really relaxing and stress relieving activity that I love.
