## My favorite museum to visit is the USS Yorktown museum in Charleston, SC. It is an aircraft carrier that was turned into a museum.

In the museum the things that you need to go see is the **Veitnam exhibit** and the main deck of the **USS Yorktown**

# Code Fencing - PHP

>I have 2 variables pricePerUnit and InvoicedUnits. Here's the code that is setting these to values:
>
>```$InvoicedUnits = ((string) $InvoiceLineItem->InvoicedUnits);```
>```$pricePerUnit = ((string) $InvoiceLineItem->PricePerUnit);```
>If I output this, I get the correct values. Lets say 5000 invoiced units and 1.00 for price.
>
>Now, I need to show the total amount spent. When I multiply these two together it doesn't work (as expected, these are strings).
>
>But I have no clue how to parse/cast/convert variables in PHP.
>
>What should I do?
